            Human birth is the most valuable gift that life can provide us.
            However one might face an emergency situation at times including
            some serious accident which calls for immediate blood requirement.
            In such critical times, it is the blood bank which comes to rescue
            of those in need.
            <h4 className="mt-4">List of Blood Banks in Kanpur</h4>
            <p className="mt-6">
              Like any cities in the region, Kanpur too has some blood banks
              which can cater to any emergency requirement of a patient. While
              some of these operate on voluntary basis and depend upon blood
              donations from volunteers, others are quite active in organizing
              blood donation camps on certain days in the year.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              This helps these blood banks to collect some valuable blood units
              which can be used by the needy in case of any emergency like
              accident and certain surgeries which require a supply of blood
              units
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              While the blood banks in Kanpur can provide blood on a voluntary
              basis, if one needs blood units beyond a prescribed limit, blood
              has to be donated in order to replenish the stock at the blood
              bank. Blood banks in Kanpur usually do not charge in cash for
              giving blood to the needy as this is considered a noble donation.
